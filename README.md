# VuePhotoSphereViewer

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://github.com/CyberAPOKA/VuePhotoSphereViewer/releases) + [Volar](https://github.com/CyberAPOKA/VuePhotoSphereViewer/releases) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://github.com/CyberAPOKA/VuePhotoSphereViewer/releases).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://github.com/CyberAPOKA/VuePhotoSphereViewer/releases).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://github.com/CyberAPOKA/VuePhotoSphereViewer/releases)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://github.com/CyberAPOKA/VuePhotoSphereViewer/releases)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://github.com/CyberAPOKA/VuePhotoSphereViewer/releases)

```sh
npm run lint
```
